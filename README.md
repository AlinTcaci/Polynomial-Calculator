# PolynomialCalculator

## Objective
A Java-based polynomial calculator capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, integration, and differentiation operations on two polynomials.

## Features
- User-friendly GUI for inputting polynomials and selecting operations.
- Error handling for improper inputs and division by zero.
- Efficient performance using TreeMap data structure.
- Unit tested with JUnit for reliability.

## Implementation
- **Packages**: Organized into data_models, business, GUI, and test.
- **Classes**: Polynomial, Operations, App, ControllerMainView, MainView, OperationTest.

## Future Development
- Support for polynomials with variables other than 'x'.
- Enhanced parsing using advanced regular expressions.
